// Solution: 
// Variables even if declared as "private" are never actually private on-chain.
// There are always ways to read out private data variables

// =>
// You could e.g. use ethers.js in your frontend to get the variable using:
// choosing a provider (could be infura)
// and then "await provider.getStorageAt(address, slot);"
// slot variable = is the STORAGE slot inside the EVM you want to read out, in our case it would be slot 1.
